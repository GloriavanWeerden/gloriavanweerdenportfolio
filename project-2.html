                The final goal of this project was to create and compile a complete branding guide for ourselves. This included creating a logo, selecting colour schemes, and general rules of use. These were to be presented in an InDesign file and submited as a clickable PDF. If you would like to see this finished product, you can check it out using the button below.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Diamond Ride was an app created for a team project in Interaction Design. This was a ride sharing app made for students in Brantford. There are very few ways to get out of Brantford that don’t involve going all the way to Toronto, then redirect from there. We also hoped to provide the option of regular commuting with someone else in order to build up a routine.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The inspiration for the name and logo came from the commuters diamond lane. The colours were meant to instill trust, since it was what people were scheduling their rides on.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">User Research</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The first step was the research to out what could possibly be a solution for traveling outside Brantford. We interviewed many students and some Brantford residences who often commuted. From here, we could properly phrase a question that we then needed to answer. From there, we decided on a ridesharing app. With it, we could create more of a community approach, with recurring rides for people who wanted to go home from school.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                We drew up user personas, including people with some to little rideshare experience. Along with each person, we drew up an empathy map. This highlighted emotions they might feel about the issue we were trying to solve and their goals if such a app to exist. From here, we could pinpoint their concerns and possible fears in ridesharing, and work to combat them.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Ideation and Creation</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Since we knew what the user might be looking for, we started researching similar products that already existed, like Uber. From here we made some rough sketches that we used in our testing. Uber was a good option to work off of, since it is widely used. The changes we had to make, however, was to make it an app used between two peers instead of a driver and passenger. We also added the option of recurring trips, so to build up a sense of community. It was easy to find participants, because we were targeting university students. We carried out our practice tests on paper. These were easy to manipulate and redesign after the testing. The testing involved giving the participant tasks, and observing how they responded to each one. When the tasks were completed, we asked general questions about their thoughts, and specific questions on areas they had trouble with. After some reworks and retesting, we came up with our final mockup in Figma for presenting to the class.
