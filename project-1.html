                The final goal of this project was to create and compile a complete branding guide for ourselves. This included creating a logo, selecting colour schemes, and general rules of use. These were to be presented in an InDesign file and submitted as a clickable PDF. If you would like to see this finished product, you can check it out using the button below.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Dr. Sabo came to our program with a project her team had already tried to begin. They had wanted to build an open-source site, that allowed conservation professionals to share papers, projects, and real-world solutions. The initial solution they first showed to us was bulky and difficult to understand. 
              </p>

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Formative Research</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                We began seeking out conservation specialists for interviews. Pooling the team's resources and connections, we recruited a wide variety of practitioners, including:
                <ul>
                  <li>Forestry Technicians</li>
                  <li>Wildlife Outreach Professionals</li>
                  <li>Conservation Education Specialists</li>
                  <li>Aquatic Biologists</li>
                  <li>Environmental Conservationists</li>
                  <li>Geo-statistical Consultant</li>
                  <li>Conservation Educators</li>

               </p>
               <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                We spoke with our participants about their daily tasks, what means they used for communication and research, and the struggles they faced in their positions. From these sessions, we uncovered that their is nearly too many resources for practitioners. Weeding through the results of a query was time consuming and it was nearly impossible to find resources specific to location. This also meant missing out on possible colleges working on similar projects in the same area. 
               </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
               Through several rounds of research and testing, we worked to find our best solution. Our first phase was a lesson in managing client expectations and exploring what our users needed. We spoke wit

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              Armed with data, we began with ideation and low-fi prototyping. We began with card sorts and tree testing. These results informed our general information architecture for the site. Once we felt confident in the structure of our site, we wrapped up our low-fi prototype. We expanded the simple skeleton by adding pages, a profile section, and a location for saved resources.

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Usability Testing</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                After recruiting more users, we began with our usability testing. On our mid-fi prototype, we tasked our users to search our site for a resource, save it, find the saved resources, and connect with the author of the resource. Our testing found that users were able to search and use the map function, but found the path to saved resources and connections a problem. We took the feedback from our users and spun it into our next round of prototypes. 
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Round two of usability testing had us exploring how users would interact with our search filters and map indicators. Users were successful in all the tests we completed. This gave us the confidence to push a head with our current designs. 
            </p>
            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
            Our last round was the team testing all of the tasks we had previously. Both qualitative and quantitative data showed users found a vast improvement in the new product. After putting on the finishing touches, we were excited to show our design to our clients.

              After seven months of research, prototyping, and testing, we presented our findings before our peers and Scotiabank sponsors. Our hard work paid off, as we were given first prize by our client and Scotiabank mentors.
